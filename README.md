# Passport-Windows Live

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [Windows Live](http://www.live.com/) using the OAuth 2.0 API.

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-windowslive

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The Windows Live authentication strategy authenticates users using a Windows
Live account and OAuth 2.0 tokens.  The strategy requires a `verify` callback,
which accepts these credentials and calls `done` providing a user, as well as
`options` specifying a client ID, client secret, and callback URL.

    passport.use(new WindowsLiveStrategy({
        clientID: WINDOWS_LIVE_CLIENT_ID,
        clientSecret: WINDOWS_LIVE_CLIENT_SECRET,
        callbackURL: "http://www.example.com/auth/windowslive/callback"
      },
      function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
        User.findOrCreate({ windowsliveId: profile.id }, function (err, user) {
          return done(err, user);
        });
      }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'windowslive'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.get('/auth/windowslive',
      passport.authenticate('windowslive'),
      // http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/live/hh243646.aspx
      { scope: ['wl.signin', 'wl.basic'] },
      function(req, res){
        // The request will be redirected to Windows Live for authentication, so
        // this function will not be called.
      });

    app.get('/auth/windowslive/callback', 
      passport.authenticate('windowslive', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        // Successful authentication, redirect home.
        res.redirect('/');
      });
